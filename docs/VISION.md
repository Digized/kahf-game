## Core Question
How do we make Surah Kahf's stories into compelling gameplay while preserving their spiritual depth?

## Design Pillars

### 1. Meaning > Mechanics
Gameplay must serve the narrative and themes, not the reverse.

### 2. Respect the Source
No trivializing sacred stories. Every mechanic should reflect deeper meaning.

### 3. Universal Access
Playable by Muslims and non-Muslims. Cultural context provided, not assumed.

### 4. Contemplation Space
Not an action game. Player needs time to think, reflect, connect.

## Genre Exploration

### Option A: Narrative Adventure
- Point-and-click style
- Story-driven decisions
- Environmental storytelling
- Examples: Journey, Gris, Kentucky Route Zero

### Option B: Puzzle-Philosophy
- Mechanics tied to story themes
- The Witness-style revelation through gameplay
- Patience as a mechanic (Moses/Khidr)
- Examples: The Witness, Braid, Talos Principle

### Option C: Anthology Experience
- Four separate game experiences
- Each story = different mechanic/genre
- Cave = stealth/survival, Gardens = resource management, Moses = puzzle, Dhul-Qarnayn = strategy
- Examples: What Remains of Edith Finch

### Option D: Text-Based Epic
- Interactive fiction
- Rich prose, meaningful choices
- Accessible, powerful, low-resource
- Examples: 80 Days, Choice of Games series

## Technical Constraints (Pi Development)

**Lightweight approaches:**
- Web-based (HTML5/JS)
- Text-based (interactive fiction)
- Pixel art (low resource)
- Procedural audio (small footprint)

**Avoid:**
- 3D engines (resource heavy)
- Large asset libraries
- Real-time rendering demands

## Next Steps

1. Pick initial direction
2. Prototype one story
3. Test core mechanic
4. Iterate or pivot
