# The Cave Sleepers

Interactive fiction prototype for Surah Al-Kahf project  
**Story Source:** Quran 18:9–26

---

## Overview

A time-displacement narrative exploring faith, persecution, and the disorientation of waking up in the wrong century. You are one of the young believers who fled persecution and hid in a cave — only to discover you've slept for over 300 years.

### Core Theme
**"What do you do when your world no longer exists?"**

Faith was tested by persecution *then*. Now it's tested by displacement.

---

## Story Summary

- **Setting:** Ancient city under tyrannical rule demanding idol worship
- **Protagonists:** Young believers who refuse to compromise their faith
- **Crisis:** Flee to a cave for safety, pray for mercy, fall asleep
- **Displacement:** Wake believing it's been one day — it's been 300+ years
- **Discovery:** The city has transformed; the empire they fled is dust
- **Choice:** Do you venture into this new world, or retreat into isolation?

---

## Gameplay

- **Format:** Browser-based interactive fiction
- **Duration:** 20–40 minutes
- **Perspective:** First-person (you are one of the youth)
- **Mechanic:** Branching narrative with meaningful choices
- **Trust Orbs:** Represent your bond with your companions (dimmed by fearful/isolating choices)

### Multiple Endings

The story branches based on key decisions:

1. **Isolation** — Stay hidden, refuse the new world
2. **Emergence** — Face the changed world together
3. **Fearful Isolation** — Panic-driven retreat into darkness
4. **Witnessing** — Accept becoming a sign/miracle to others
5. **Rejection** — Refuse to be mythologized, return to sleep
6. **Additional variations** based on who enters the city

## Design Philosophy

### What Worked from Moses Prototype
- Clean, distraction-free reading experience
- Meaningful choice mechanic (not just flavor)
- Visual feedback for player state (orbs)
- Multiple endings that genuinely differ
- No skill checks or "fail states" — only narrative consequences

### Adaptations for Cave Sleepers
- Removed "patience/questioning" mechanic (Moses-specific)
- Added "companions' bond" represented by trust orbs
- Emphasized disorientation and time displacement
- Darker visual palette
- Longer story (more scenes, more branching)
- Themes of belonging, identity, and witnessing

---

## Target Audience

**Age:** 24–30  
**Genre familiarity:** Interactive fiction, walking sims, contemplative games  
**Faith background:** Muslim or curious about Quranic narratives  
**Tone preference:** Literary, reflective, emotionally resonant

Not preachy. Not a quiz. A story that wrestles with timeless questions through a specific lens.

---

## Themes Explored

- **Faith Under Pressure:** Persecution vs. displacement as different tests
- **Time Displacement:** Everything you knew is gone
- **Companionship:** Your fellow believers as the only constants
- **Choice vs. Destiny:** God preserved you — but for what?
- **Witnessing:** What does it mean to be a living sign?
- **Belonging:** Can you build a life in a world that remembers you as myth?

---

## Development Notes

- Built as part of 4-story Surah Kahf game concept
- Reuses proven engine structure from Moses prototype
- Designed for easy iteration and content updates
- Could be extended with:
  - Sound design (cave ambience, city sounds)
  - Subtle background animations
  - Character portraits
  - Save/load functionality
  - Analytics to track common player paths

## Story Beats (Quran 18:9–26)

1. Youth refuse idol worship in a city under persecution
2. Flee to a cave, pray for mercy and guidance
3. God causes them to sleep (verse 11: "We sealed their ears")
4. Wake up thinking it's been a day or part of a day
5. Send someone to buy food with old currency
6. Discover centuries have passed; city is now Muslim
7. People discover them as a miracle/sign
8. Debate over the cave and its meaning
9. They die (or return to sleep, interpretations vary)

**This prototype focuses on beats 1–7**, ending at the moment of discovery/decision.
