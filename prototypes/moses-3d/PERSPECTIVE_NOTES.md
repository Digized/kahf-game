# Perspective Design Decision

## Current: Moses POV ✅

**Why it works:**
- **Emotional engagement** - Player *feels* the tension between wanting to question and holding patience
- **Immediate stakes** - Every choice costs patience (mechanic reinforces theme)
- **Universal struggle** - Everyone has questioned divine wisdom or authority; relatable
- **Payoff** - The revelation hits harder when you've been struggling to understand

**For 24-30y gamers:** This demographic values **agency** and **meaningful choice**. Playing Moses gives them real weight to their decisions.

## Alternative 1: Khidr POV

**Concept:** You ARE Khidr, carrying out divine instructions while testing Moses.

**Pros:**
- Interesting moral weight ("I know the truth, but I must let him struggle")
- Could explore the burden of divine knowledge

**Cons:**
- **Removes core tension** - You already know WHY, so choices feel arbitrary
- Less emotional investment - you're observing Moses's struggle, not feeling it
- Harder to justify player choices (Khidr has no agency; he's following orders)

**Verdict:** Intellectually interesting but emotionally hollow for gameplay.

## Alternative 2: Third-Person Observer

**Concept:** Watch the story unfold cinematically. No direct control.

**Pros:**
- Could be beautiful/contemplative
- Works for pure narrative focus

**Cons:**
- **No agency** - This is a *game*. Players need choices that matter.
- Passive experience = weaker engagement
- Better suited to a film/animated short, not interactive medium

**Verdict:** Wrong format. If you remove player choice, you lose what makes it a *game*.

## Conclusion

**Moses POV is the correct choice for this project.**

The 24-30y audience wants:
- Real stakes (patience mechanic)
- Emotional resonance (feeling the struggle)
- Meaningful choice (question vs. stay silent)

Khidr POV or third-person would remove what makes the experience powerful.

**Keep it Moses.**
