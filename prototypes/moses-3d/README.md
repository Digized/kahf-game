## The Story

You are Moses, prophet and leader. Word reaches you of a mysterious teacher named Khidr who possesses knowledge beyond yours. You seek him out, promising patience — but divine wisdom tests even the strongest faith.

Three tests of patience.  
One profound lesson about knowledge, humility, and trust in what cannot be seen.
