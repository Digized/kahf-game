# PROJECT STATUS

## Kahf Game Development - Current State

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15  
**Active Branch:** master  
**Status:** ✅ First Prototype Complete

---

## Completed Work

### 📚 Design Foundation (master branch)
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Vision document (VISION.md)
- ✅ All four story design documents:
  - Cave Sleepers (STORY_01_CAVE.md)
  - Two Gardens (STORY_02_GARDENS.md)
  - Moses & Khidr (STORY_03_MOSES_KHIDR.md)
  - Dhul-Qarnayn (STORY_04_DHUL_QARNAYN.md)
- ✅ Synthesis document with strategic approaches (SYNTHESIS.md)
- ✅ Experimental branches roadmap (BRANCHES.md)

### 🎮 Moses & Khidr Prototype (moses-if-prototype → master)
- ✅ **Fully playable web-based interactive fiction**
- ✅ Complete narrative implementation
- ✅ Patience mechanic (3 questions allowed)
- ✅ Multiple branching paths
- ✅ Two distinct endings (patient vs impatient)
- ✅ Responsive UI with smooth animations
- ✅ Zero dependencies (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly

**Location:** `prototypes/moses-if/`  
**How to play:** Open `prototypes/moses-if/index.html` in browser

## What Works

The Moses prototype successfully:
1. **Captures the core theme** - Patience vs questioning divine wisdom
2. **Creates emotional weight** - Player feels Moses's struggle
3. **Teaches through gameplay** - Mechanic reinforces narrative lesson
4. **Runs on Pi** - Lightweight, no external dependencies
5. **Multiple playthroughs** - Different choices = different experience

---

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (Branch Exploration)
1. **Test the prototype** with actual users (digized + others?)
2. **Create Cave Sleepers prototype** (different genre test)
3. **Decide:** Expand Moses or build all four stories?

### Short Term
- Add audio/narration to Moses prototype
- Implement save/load system
- Polish UI/UX based on feedback
- Create second story prototype (Gardens or Cave)

### Medium Term
- Choose final direction (anthology vs single game)
- Build remaining stories if anthology approach
- Art direction decisions
- Sound design

### Long Term
- Full production
- Accessibility features
- Localization
- Distribution (itch.io, web hosting, etc.)

## Technical Stack

**Current (Proven):**
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Git for version control
- Markdown for documentation
- Browser-based (works everywhere)

**Considering:**
- Ink narrative scripting (for complex branching)
- Godot (if visual prototype needed)
- Tone.js (for procedural audio)

---

## Metrics

**Lines of Code:** ~750 (Moses prototype)  
**Stories Designed:** 4/4 (100%)  
**Playable Prototypes:** 1/4 (25%)  
**Development Time:** ~2-3 hours (design + prototype)  
**File Size:** <30KB total (extremely lightweight)

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Text-first works well** - Low barrier to entry, fast iteration
2. **Mechanics can teach** - Patience meter reinforces theme
3. **Pi-friendly is possible** - No need for heavy engines
4. **Design-first pays off** - Clear docs made prototype easy
5. **Git branching works** - Experiment without risk

---

## Open Questions

1. Should we continue with text-based, or explore visual?
2. Anthology (4 separate games) or unified experience?
3. Target audience: Muslims only, or broader?
4. Distribution model: Free, pay-what-you-want, paid?
5. How deep should we go on each story?
