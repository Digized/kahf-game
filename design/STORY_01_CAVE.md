# Story 1: The Cave Sleepers (Ashab al-Kahf)

## Narrative Summary

Young believers in a polytheistic society refuse to worship false gods. Facing persecution and death, they flee to a cave seeking refuge. Allah causes them to sleep for 300+ years. They wake, thinking only a day has passed, and discover their world transformed.

## Themes
- **Faith under pressure** — choosing belief despite consequences
- **Divine protection** — trust in unseen help
- **Time displacement** — waking to a changed world
- **Community** — strength in numbers, shared conviction
- **Uncertainty** — not knowing how long you'll wait

## Gameplay Potential

### Mechanic Ideas

**Option A: Stealth/Evasion**
- Navigate hostile city
- Avoid guards, informants
- Reach the cave
- Tension: detection = death

**Option B: Time Management**
- Limited time before capture
- Gather supplies, warn others
- Decide who comes, who stays
- Moral weight of abandoning community

**Option C: Sleep/Wake Cycle**
- Enter cave, sleep sequence
- Wake thinking it's been a day
- Exploration reveals centuries passed
- Mystery: what happened while we slept?

**Option D: Faith Mechanic**
- Prayer/reflection moments strengthen resolve
- Doubt weakens group cohesion
- Choice: flee or face martyrdom
- Non-violent conflict resolution

### Environmental Storytelling
- Ancient city vs future city (same location)
- Cave as sanctuary — simple, timeless
- Dog companion (mentioned in Quran)
- Sun's movement avoiding sleepers (divine sign)

### Emotional Arc
1. **Fear** — persecution, danger
2. **Flight** — desperate escape
3. **Peace** — safety in cave, surrender to God
4. **Wonder** — waking to new world
5. **Purpose** — why were we preserved?

## Technical Approach

**Text-based version:**
- Choice-driven narrative
- Timed decisions (pressure simulation)
- Multiple perspectives (each youth)
- Environmental descriptions paint the city

**Visual version:**
- Pixel art city/cave
- Day/night cycle
- Minimalist UI (tension through simplicity)
- Color palette shift (old world vs new)

## Questions to Resolve

- Do we show the persecution directly, or start at the cave decision?
- How much player agency vs scripted narrative?
- Single playthrough or replayable with different outcomes?
- Do we show the 300 years, or cut to awakening?
