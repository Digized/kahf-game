# Story 2: The Two Gardens

## Narrative Summary

Two friends: one wealthy with abundant gardens, one humble but faithful. The rich man boasts his gardens will never perish, denies the afterlife. The humble friend warns him to be grateful. The gardens are destroyed overnight. The rich man is left with regret.

## Themes
- **Gratitude vs arrogance**
- **Wealth as test**
- **Humility vs pride**
- **Consequences of ingratitude**
- **True vs false security**

## Gameplay Potential

### Mechanic Ideas

**Option A: Garden Management**
- Player IS the rich man
- Manage resources, expand garden
- Choices: share with others or hoard
- Slow corruption through arrogance
- Sudden loss, forced reflection

**Option B: Dual Perspective**
- Play both friends alternately
- Rich man: expansion, optimization
- Humble man: community care, simple living
- Parallel lives, diverging outcomes

**Option C: Conversation System**
- Dialogue-heavy
- Humble friend tries to guide rich friend
- Player choices determine relationship
- Tension: friendship vs truth-telling

**Option D: Economic Simulation**
- Resource management
- Prosperity meter vs pride meter
- Balance gratitude/charity with growth
- Warning signs before collapse

### Environmental Storytelling
- Lush gardens slowly becoming ostentatious
- Humble friend's simple home
- Visual contrast: excess vs sufficiency
- Destruction sequence (overnight ruin)

### Emotional Arc
1. **Success** — gardens thriving, wealth growing
2. **Pride** — "I did this, I earned this"
3. **Warning** — friend's concern ignored
4. **Loss** — everything destroyed
5. **Regret** — "If only I had been grateful"

## Mechanical Metaphor

**Pride as game mechanic:**
- The more you succeed, the harder to see truth
- UI becomes cluttered with wealth stats
- Humble friend's dialogue fades/becomes skippable
- Loss comes without warning (reflects the story)

**Gratitude counter:**
- Acts of charity, sharing knowledge
- Acknowledging divine blessing
- Resisting urge to boast
- Protects against total loss?

## Technical Approach

**Text-based:**
- Resource management through choices
- Conversation trees with friend
- Narration reflects character's mindset
- Sudden shift to ruin

**Visual:**
- Top-down farm/garden management
- Split-screen (both lives)
- Time-lapse sequences
- Color desaturation as pride grows

## Questions to Resolve

- Can the player "win" by choosing humility?
- Or is loss inevitable (teaching the lesson)?
- How do we avoid preaching?
- Balance between simulation and narrative?
